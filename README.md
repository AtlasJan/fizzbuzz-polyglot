FizzBuzz is a nearly trivial programming exercise, sometimes used in
job interviews to weed out candidates who say they can program but
really can't.

The requirements are simple:

> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples
> of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of
> five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and
> five print "FizzBuzz".

In my [fizzbuz-c](https://github.com/Keith-S-Thompson/fizzbuzz-c) project
I present multiple (25 at last count) C solutions.

Here I present multiple implementations, one in each language.  The current set of languages is

<ul>
    <li>Ada</li>
    <li>BASIC (bwBASIC)</li>
    <li>Bash</li>
    <li>C</li>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>C#</li>
    <li>C-shell</li>
    <li>Fortran</li>
    <li>Go</li>
    <li>Guile</li>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>Lua</li>
    <li>Pascal</li>
    <li>PHP</li>
    <li>Perl 5</li>
    <li>Perl 6</li>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>Ruby</li>
    <li>Scala</li>
    <li>Bourne shell</li>
</ul>

Do not take this too seriously.
