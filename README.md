FizzBuzz is a nearly trivial programming exercise, sometimes used in
job interviews to weed out candidates who say they can program but
really can't.

The requirements are simple:

> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples
> of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of
> five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and
> five print "FizzBuzz".

In my [fizzbuz-c](https://github.com/Keith-S-Thompson/fizzbuzz-c) project
I present multiple (26 at last count) C solutions.

Here I present multiple implementations, one in each language.  The current set of languages is

- Ada
- BASIC (bwBASIC)
- Bash
- C
- C++
- C#
- C-shell
- D
- Fortran
- Go
- Guile
- Java
- JavaScript
- Lua
- Objective-C
- Pascal
- PHP
- Perl 5
- Perl 6
- Python
- Ruby
- Scala
- sh (Bourne shell)
- Tcl

The `verify` script executes each program and confirms that its output
is correct.  It works on my system, Ubuntu 12.04 with a certain set
of packages installed.

Do not take this too seriously.
