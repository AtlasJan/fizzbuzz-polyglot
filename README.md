FizzBuzz is a nearly trivial programming exercise, sometimes used in
job interviews to weed out candidates who say they can program but
really can't.

The requirements are simple:

> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples
> of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of
> five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and
> five print "FizzBuzz".

In my [fizzbuz-c](https://github.com/Keith-S-Thompson/fizzbuzz-c) project
I present multiple (24 at last count) C solutions.

Here I present multiple implementations, one in each language.  The current set of languages is

    Ada
    Bash
    BASIC (bwBASIC)
    C
    C#
    C++
    C-shell
    Fortran
    Go
    Guile
    Java
    JavaScript
    Lua
    Pascal
    Perl5
    Perl6
    PHP
    Python
    Ruby
    Bourne shell

Do not take this too seriously.
