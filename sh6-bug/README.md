The `fizzbuzz.sh6` program fails under Ubuntu 16.10.

I installed osh version 4.2.1 from [this tarball](http://v6shell.org/src/osh-4.2.1.tar.gz).
The problem appears to be a bug in the external `goto` command.

The failure occurs on Ubuntu 16.04 and 16.10.
It does not occur on Ubuntu 14.04 or CentOS 5.11.
(All systems are x86_64.)

`sh6_bug.bash` is a bash script that clones, builds, and installs the
`v6shell` package, and runs a test script.

The expected output
of the test script is:

    one
    three

The output on Ubuntu 16.10 is:

    one
    wo: not found

implying that the `goto` command did a seek to the wrong location.

`sh6-bug.bash.out` is the output of `sh-bug.bash` on Ubuntu 16.10:

    ./sh6-bug.bash > sh6-bug.bash.out 2>&1

`sh6-bug.bash-strace.out` is the output of `sh-bug.bash -strace`:

    ./sh6-bug.bash -strace > sh6-bug.bash-strace.out 2>&1

`make-check.out` is the output of `make check`, run in the `v6shell` top-level directory.

`config.h` is generated by `make check`.

Both are from the `current` branch:

        Possible fix - sh6 / goto prob - Ubuntu 16.(04|10)
        
        The prob (problem) noted above was reported to me by @Keith-S-Thompson.

The test passes when I run it with `osh` rather than `sh6`.
